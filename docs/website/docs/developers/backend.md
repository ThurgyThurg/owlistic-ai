# Server

Owlistic backend is built using Go, a statically typed, compiled language. The main reason for choosing Go is its strong support for concurrency and efficient memory management, which are crucial for event-driven systems. It also uses the PostgreSQL database for data persistence and NATS as an event streaming system to push real-time updates to clients.
