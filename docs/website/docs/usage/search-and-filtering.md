# Search and Filtering

Efficiently managing your notes is crucial, and our Owlistic provides powerful search and filtering capabilities to help you find what you need quickly.

## Searching Notes

To search for notes, use the search bar located at the top of the application. You can enter keywords or phrases that are present in the note titles or content. The search results will dynamically update as you type.

### Search Syntax

- **Exact Match**: Use quotes to search for an exact phrase. For example, `"meeting notes"` will return notes that contain that exact phrase.
- **Exclusion**: Use a minus sign to exclude terms. For example, `notes -draft` will return notes that contain "notes" but not "draft".
- **Wildcard Search**: Use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to match any number of characters. For example, `note*` will return notes that start with "note".

## Filtering Notes

You can filter your notes based on various criteria to narrow down your search results. The filtering options include:

- **Tags**: Filter notes by specific tags. Click on a tag to view all notes associated with it.
- **Date**: Use the date filter to find notes created or modified within a specific date range.
- **Categories**: If you have organized your notes into categories, you can filter by category to view relevant notes.

## Combining Search and Filters

You can combine search terms with filters for more precise results. For example, searching for `"project update"` while filtering by the "Work" category will show only the relevant notes that match both criteria.

## Tips for Effective Searching

- Regularly tag your notes to make filtering easier.
- Use descriptive titles for your notes to improve searchability.
- Keep your notes organized in categories to enhance the filtering process.

By utilizing the search and filtering features effectively, you can streamline your workflow and quickly access the information you need.
