# Pull Requests

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Owlistic! This document will guide you through the process of submitting a pull request.

## How to Submit a Pull Request

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/owlistic-notes/owlistic.git
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes in the codebase. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and guidelines.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add a new feature"
   ```

6. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "Pull Requests" tab. Click on the "New Pull Request" button. Select your branch and submit the pull request.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Descriptive Title**: Provide a clear and concise title for your pull request that summarizes the changes made.
- **Detailed Description**: Include a detailed description of the changes, why they were made, and any relevant context.
- **Link to Issues**: If your pull request addresses an existing issue, please reference it in the description (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- **Testing**: Ensure that your changes are tested and do not break existing functionality. Include tests if applicable.

## Review Process

Once your pull request is submitted, the maintainers will review your changes. They may request modifications or provide feedback. Please be responsive to their comments and make necessary adjustments.
