# Development Setup

To contribute to the Owlistic, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or above)
- **Git** (for version control)
- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owlistic-notes/owlistic.git
cd note-taking-app
```

## Installing Dependencies

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Making Changes

You can now make changes to the codebase. As you edit files, the development server will automatically reload to reflect your changes.

## Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your contributions, ensure that all tests pass. You can run the tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Submitting Your Changes

Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them and push to your forked repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Finally, create a pull request to the main repository for review.
