# Managing Tasks and To-Do Lists

In this section, we will explore how to effectively manage tasks and to-do lists within the Owlistic. This feature allows you to keep track of your tasks alongside your notes, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.

## Creating a Task

To create a task, simply add a checkbox in your note using the following Markdown syntax:

```markdown
- [ ] This is a task
```

This will render as an unchecked checkbox in your note. You can check it off by changing it to:

```markdown
- [x] This is a completed task
```

## Organizing Tasks

You can organize your tasks by using headings and lists. For example:

```markdown
## Daily Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4
```

This structure helps you categorize your tasks and makes it easier to manage them.

## Due Dates

To add due dates to your tasks, you can include them in parentheses next to the task:

```markdown
- [ ] Task 1 (Due: 2023-10-01)
```

This will help you keep track of deadlines.

## Task Filtering

The app provides a filtering feature that allows you to view only your tasks. You can filter tasks by their status (completed or not completed) to focus on what needs to be done.

## Conclusion

Managing tasks and to-do lists within the Owlistic is straightforward and integrates seamlessly with your notes. Use the Markdown syntax to create, organize, and track your tasks effectively. Happy note-taking!
