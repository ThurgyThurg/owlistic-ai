# Synchronization

Synchronization allows you to access your notes across multiple devices seamlessly. This feature ensures that any changes made on one device are reflected on all other devices where the app is installed.

## Setting Up Synchronization

To enable synchronization, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account**: You need to create an account to use the synchronization feature. This account will store your notes in the cloud.
   
2. **Log In**: After creating your account, log in to the app on all devices you wish to synchronize.

3. **Enable Sync**: Go to the settings menu and enable the synchronization option. This will allow the app to automatically sync your notes.

## How Synchronization Works

- **Real-Time Updates**: Any changes made to your notes will be updated in real-time across all devices.
- **Conflict Resolution**: In case of conflicting changes (e.g., editing the same note on two devices simultaneously), the app will prompt you to choose which version to keep.
- **Offline Access**: You can access your notes offline. Changes made while offline will sync automatically once you reconnect to the internet.

## Troubleshooting Synchronization Issues

If you encounter issues with synchronization, consider the following steps:

- **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure that your device is connected to the internet.
- **Log Out and Log In**: Sometimes, logging out and back into your account can resolve sync issues.
- **Update the App**: Make sure you are using the latest version of the app, as updates often include bug fixes related to synchronization.
