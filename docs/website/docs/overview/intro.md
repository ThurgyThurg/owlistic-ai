## Welcome to Owlistic!

Hi, I'm the creator of **Owlistic**, an open-source, event-driven note-taking app that I originally built for myself.

Owlistic started out of a simple need: I have been a long time user the _Best Note Taking App_ that not-so-recently became almost unusable without paid subscription. Also, since I started my self-hosting journey, I was already looking for an alternative that was free and open-source, without loosing the user experience and performance of such _Best Note Taking App_.

So that's where things paired up. I needed a simple-to-use note-taking app with a native desktop/mobile app, with support for inline tasks, that was blazing fast at synchronizing notes and tasks across my devices. And so, I started building Owlistic and took it as my personal deep dive into event-driven system design.

By contributing Owlistic to the open-source community, I'd like to think I am also giving back to the open-source community from which I have greatly benefit. It's a small way for me to pay it forward and help others build their own solutions, free from the limitations of proprietary software.

I'm excited to share this project with the community and invite you to join me in making it even better!
