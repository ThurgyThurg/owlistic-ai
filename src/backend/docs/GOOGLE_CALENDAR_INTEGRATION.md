```env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret  
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/api/v1/calendar/oauth/callback
```

### Google Cloud Console Setup

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:

   - Search for "Google Calendar API"
   - Click "Enable"

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/calendar/oauth/callback`
   - Copy Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env` file

## API Endpoints

```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "event-uuid",

}
```

#### Update Calendar Event
```http
PUT /api/v1/calendar/events/{event_id}
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Updated Meeting Title",
  "start_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",

```

Leave `calendar_id` empty to sync all calendars.

## Database Models

### GoogleCalendarCredentials
Stores OAuth tokens for Google Calendar access:
- `access_token`: Current access token
- `refresh_token`: Refresh token for obtaining new access tokens
- `expires_at`: Token expiration time
- Auto-refresh when tokens expire

### CalendarEvent
Local representation of calendar events:
- Links to Google Calendar events via `google_event_id`
- Can be linked to notes and tasks
- Stores metadata and sync information

### CalendarSync
Tracks sync configuration per calendar:
- `sync_direction`: read_only, write_only, bidirectional
- `sync_token`: For incremental sync with Google Calendar
- `last_sync_at`: Timestamp of last successful sync

## Telegram Integration

### Automatic Calendar Event Creation

When you send a message to the Telegram bot that's classified as a calendar event:

1. **With Google Calendar Connected**:
   ```
   "Meeting with John tomorrow at 3pm"
   ```
   Creates actual Google Calendar event:
   ```
   üìÖ Calendar event created successfully!

   **Meeting with John**
   üìÖ January 16, 2024 at 3:00 PM

   ‚úÖ Added to your Google Calendar
   üîó Event ID: abc-123-def
   ```

2. **Without Google Calendar**:
   ```
   üìÖ Calendar event detected, but you haven't connected your Google Calendar yet.

   Use /api/v1/calendar/oauth/authorize to connect your calendar, then try again.

   For now, I'll save this as a task:

   üìÖ Calendar event saved as task: "Meeting with John"
   üìù Note ID: xyz-789
   ```

### Smart Date/Time Parsing

The system intelligently parses date and time information:
- **"tomorrow at 3pm"** ‚Üí Sets event for next day at 3:00 PM
- **"meeting Friday morning"** ‚Üí Sets event for Friday at 9:00 AM
- **"lunch today"** ‚Üí Sets event for today at default time
- **"all day conference Tuesday"** ‚Üí Sets all-day event for Tuesday

## Features

### Bidirectional Sync
- Events created in Google Calendar appear in Owlistic
- Events created in Owlistic appear in Google Calendar
- Updates and deletions sync in both directions

### Intelligent Classification
- AI automatically detects calendar events from natural language
- Extracts title, date, time, and duration when possible
- Falls back to task creation when calendar isn't connected

### Task/Note Integration
- Calendar events can be linked to notes and tasks
- Create events from task due dates
- Generate tasks from calendar events

### Incremental Sync
- Uses Google Calendar sync tokens for efficient updates
- Only syncs changed events, not entire calendar
- Configurable sync frequency

## Security

### OAuth 2.0 Flow
- Secure OAuth 2.0 authorization with Google
- Tokens stored encrypted in database
- Automatic token refresh when expired

### User Isolation
- Each user's calendar data is completely isolated
- Users can only access their own events and calendars
- Proper authentication required for all endpoints

### Data Privacy
- Calendar data synchronized securely
- Can revoke access at any time
- Local calendar events deleted when access revoked

## Troubleshooting

### OAuth Issues
```
"missing Google OAuth credentials in environment variables"
```
- Ensure `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` are set
- Verify redirect URI matches Google Cloud Console configuration

### Calendar Access
```
"no calendar credentials found for user"
```
- User needs to complete OAuth flow first
- Check OAuth status endpoint

### Sync Problems
```
"failed to sync calendar"
```
- Check if access token is still valid
- Verify calendar ID exists and user has access
- Check Google Calendar API quotas

### Telegram Calendar Events
- If calendar creation fails, events are saved as tasks
- Connect Google Calendar for full calendar integration
- Check that date/time parsing works correctly

## Example Usage Flow

1. **Setup Google Calendar**:
   - Configure environment variables
   - User visits authorization URL
   - Complete OAuth flow

2. **Enable Calendar Sync**:
   - List available calendars
   - Choose calendars to sync
   - Set sync direction

3. **Create Events**:
   - Via API endpoints
   - Through Telegram messages
   - From tasks or notes

4. **Sync Events**:
   - Automatic background sync
   - Manual sync triggers
   - Real-time updates

The Google Calendar integration provides a seamless way to manage calendar events within your Owlistic AI workflow, with intelligent AI-powered event creation and full bidirectional synchronization.
